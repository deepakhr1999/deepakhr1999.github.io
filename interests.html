				<h3 class="py-3">Machine Learning</h3>
				<p>
					I gained a lot of interest in Machine Learning when I heard AlphaZero beat Stockfish in chess, although the developers knew not much about the game. Also I rembered various stages in computer programming as taught in our text; I remember it said "Artificial Intelligence: Still in development". I started off with Machine Learning by auditing various online beginner courses. I also attended the <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/SSDL">Summer School on Deep Learning</a> at NITK. It gave me the confidence to proceed with Deep learning using Tensorflow.

				<h3 class="py-3">Blockchain</h3>
				<p>
					I was excited with blockchain when I learned about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin built over blockchain and is unhackable*. However, I matched frequencies with the concept of decentralization and distributedness as I spent more time on projects, using the Hyperledger Fabric Platform. I developed an MVP for an eKYC webapp. I proceeded to deploy a production level blockchain setup for startup, <a href="https://agroblock.io/">Agroblock</a> which has gained good recognition in the field of supply-chain traceability.

				<h3 class="py-3">Web Development</h3>
				<p>
					It is always fun to make stuff look good. Web Development started to grow on me as I learned about the iconic trio, HTML, PHP and MySQL. I teamed up with my father and developed a queue management system, <a href="http://bestq.in">BestQ</a> for his clinic. I also learned about and used Django when I worked on my school project to make a <a href="https://github.com/RohanShrothrium/BDP">Blood Donation Portal</a>. Later, I came to know about asychronous requests and load sections of pages independently and yes, it is satisfying XD. I spend some of my free time to learn stuff about ReactJS and work on small projects.
